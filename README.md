# Generative AI Project

This repository contains the implementation of our Generative AI project for the course.  
The goal of the project is to design an AI system capable of detecting and blocking toxic messages 
(hate speech, racism, homophobia, insults, threats, etc.) while taking into account context such as 
sarcasm or dark humor.  

The project was divided into five phases: **Research, Data Engineering, ML Training, Quality, and Integration**.  
Each phase corresponds to a section in the final report and to one or more Jupyter notebooks in this repository.
